Project Descrription:
 build a Travel Agency website and add CSS, dynamic HTML and JavaScript features:
the proejct consist of three pages: Index.html, contact.html & register.html 

// JavaScript Logic:
// **Goal:Add dynamic behavior and DOM manipulation as well as form Validate**
// Steps:
// 1.	Image Gallery Logic:
//   -Create arrays for images, descriptions, and URL links (4 images).
//   -Dynamically generate table rows (tr) based on array length and cells (<td>).
//   -Add event listeners for each table cell to display image previews and open the URL link on click.
// 2.  Image Window Opening & Closing:
//   - on click @ each table rows a new window opens with cllickable links and gives the user 5 seconds to react. 
//   - if user clicks the link in new window a website will open to provide more information about destination.
//   - if user doesnt react within 5 seconds the new window will close automatically.
// 3.	Form input logic and Validation:
//   -Use JavaScript confirm() dialogs to ask users if they are sure about submitting or resetting the form.
//   -Create functions to validate each form input (ensure that the name, address, etc., are not empty).
//   -showing instructional text when inputs are focused and highlighting incorrect fields.
//   -Prevent form submission if validation fails.
